# web_assignment

In this assignment i built HTML page dashboard, that showcases featuring the analysis. Added three folders assets, Resources and visualizations and included index.html in the main folder with the resources containing the csv file for using the website.Deployed it to GitHub Pages. Created individual pages for each plot and navigate between them. These pages contained the visualizations. I built a landing page to provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data that was used to build them.
